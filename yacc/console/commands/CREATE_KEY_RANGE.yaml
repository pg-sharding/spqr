name: CREATE KEY RANGE
description: |
  This command is used to create a new key range. Since the key space is an ordered set, 
  it is enough to specify only one end of the range.
  
  For composite sharding keys, specify multiple values separated by commas that correspond 
  to each column in the distribution.

syntax: |
  CREATE KEY RANGE [ <keyRangeID> ]
  FROM <lowerBound>
  ROUTE TO <shardID> 
  FOR DISTRIBUTION <distributionID>
  
  where lowerBound is a single value or comma-separated values for composite keys 
  (e.g., "100, 'value'" for a two-column key)

parameters:
  - name: keyRangeID
    description: Unique identifier for the key range (optional, auto-generated if omitted)
  - name: lowerBound
    description: Lower boundary value (inclusive). Can be integer, string, or comma-separated values for composite keys
  - name: shardID
    description: Target shard ID where data in this range is stored
  - name: distributionID
    description: Distribution ID this key range belongs to

examples:
  - description: Single column key range
    code: CREATE KEY RANGE krid1 FROM 1000 ROUTE TO shard1 FOR DISTRIBUTION ds1;
  - description: Composite key range with two integers
    code: CREATE KEY RANGE krid2 FROM 0, 100 ROUTE TO shard2 FOR DISTRIBUTION ds2;
  - description: Composite key range with integer and varchar
    code: "CREATE KEY RANGE krid3 FROM 100, 'aaaaa' ROUTE TO shard3 FOR DISTRIBUTION ds3;"

tips:
  - Value bounds should be continuous and non-overlapping
  - Use SHOW KEY RANGES to list existing ranges
  - Lock key ranges during maintenance operations with LOCK KEY RANGE
  - Key ranges are immutable once created; use SPLIT or UNITE for modifications
  - Consider boundary values carefully to distribute data evenly
