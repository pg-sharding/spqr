Feature: Coordinator test
  Background:
    #
    # Make host "coordinator" take control

    Given cluster is up and running

    Then command return code should be "0"

  Scenario: Second coordinator awaits

    """
    Then command return code should be "0"
    And SQL result should match regexp
