<h4>Stateless Postgres Query Router is a production-ready system for horizontal scaling of PostgreSQL via sharding.</h4>

---

PostgreSQL is awesome, but it's hard to manage a single database with some terabytes of data and 10<sup>5</sup>+ queries per second. Current sharding solutions focus on analytical and hybrid workloads (OLAP, HTAP). Moreover, most of those solutions do not provide a smooth path for monolith to sharded transitions, which is why Yandex Cloud's Data Platform team developed SPQR.

SPQR is a production-ready system for horizontal scaling of PostgreSQL via sharding. We appreciate any kind of feedback and contribution to the project.

To get started, please visit our [documentation](https://pg-sharding.tech). The full list of features is available [here](https://pg-sharding.tech/features/).

## Development

You can use `make run` for a quick example using Docker. For local development, you need [the latest Go version](https://go.dev/dl/).

How to build:
```
make
make build
```

How to run:
```
spqr-router run --config path-to-router-config.yaml
```

## Tests

SPQR has all types of tests: unit, regress, and end-to-end. These tests require Docker Compose, and can be run using `make`. For more information on testing, please see `unittest`, `regress`, and `feature` sections in [Makefile](./Makefile).

## Support

We have a [Telegram chat](https://t.me/+jMGhyjwicpI3ZWQy) to discuss SPQR usage and development. If you're missing a feature or have found a bug, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/issues/new/choose). We appreciate any kind of feedback and contribution to the project.
