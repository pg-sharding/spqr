# Coordinator timing settings (optional)

# gRPC keepalive settings for router connections (optional)
# Prevents connections from being closed by network intermediaries during idle periods
# IMPORTANT: If iteration_timeout is high (e.g., 5m), keepalive must be lower than network timeouts
# router_keepalive_time: 30s      # How often to send keepalive pings (default: 30s)
# router_keepalive_timeout: 20s   # How long to wait for ping response (default: 20s)
