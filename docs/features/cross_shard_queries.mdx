title: 'Limited cross-shard queries'
---

SPQR is optimized for single-shard OLTP queries. But SPQR router supports limited subset of cross-shard queries. For example, `SELECT * FROM` without `WHERE` clause or DDL commands. This is made from best-effort logic in a non-disruptive and non-consistent way and is used mainly for testing purposes. Please be carefull using this feature in production, cross-shard snapshot will be inconsistent. 

You can force disable this feature by setting a `query_routing.default_route_behaviour` to `BLOCK` in your router config file.

We have long-term plans to support routing queries for 2 or more shards efficiently.
