title: 'Cross-shard queries'
---

SPQR is optimized for single-shard OLTP queries but supports limited cross-shard operations:

- `SELECT * FROM` without `WHERE` clause and DDL commands (best-effort with no snapshot isolation, see [Distributed Transactions](/sharding/distributed_transactions))
- [Bulk operations](/sharding/bulk) (COPY, batch INSERT)

Disable with `query_routing.default_route_behaviour: BLOCK` in router config.
