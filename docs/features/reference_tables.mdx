title: 'Reference tables'
---

Sometimes, it can be useful to have one or more tables on each shard with the same data. 

SPQR supports what are known as [reference table](/sharding/reference_tables). A reference table is replicated across all shards and is not split into separate partitions. Every shard has **a local copy of the table**, which reduces network overhead and allows for fast access to frequently used data.


```sql
\c spqr-console
CREATE REFERENCE TABLE tax_rates;
 create reference table 
------------------------
 table    -> tax_rates
 shard id -> sh1
(2 rows)
```
