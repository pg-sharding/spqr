title: 'Sharding'
---

The router knows that some tables have been [split into shards](/sharding/sharded_tables). If possible, the router tries to determine on the first transaction statement to which shard this transaction should be sent.

```sql
-- This query should works with properly sharding rules
INSERT INTO test(id, age) VALUES (10, 16);
```

But you can explicitly specify a shard or a sharding key in a comment request

```sql
-- But if you want to explicitly pass sharding key, you can do it like this
INSERT INTO test(id, age) VALUES (10, 16) /*__spqr__sharding_key: 30*/;
```

You can set [default shard](/sharding/default_shard) for distribution. If a default shard exists router routs the query to the default shard for existing route.
