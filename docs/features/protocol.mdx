title: 'Works over PostgreSQL protocol'

import ConsoleExample from '/snippets/console_example.mdx';

The application communicates with the router using the PostgreSQL protocol. In other words, the application doesn't even know that it's communicating with a Golang application and not a regular PostgreSQL cluster.

Moreover, you can connect to the router and the coordinator via psql to perform administrative tasks. SPQR has an administrative console. You can find the console port in your config file.
