## What is SPQR

SPQR (Stateless Postgres Query Router) is a production-ready system for horizontal scaling of PostgreSQL via sharding. A real open source distributed under the PostgreSQL Global Development Group License.

## Why SPQR

PostgreSQL is awesome, but it's hard to manage a single database with some terabytes of data and 10<sup>5</sup>+ queries per second. Existing sharding solutions focus on analytical and hybrid workloads (OLAP, HTAP). Moreover, most of those solutions do not provide a simple, painless path for the monolith \<-\> sharded transitions. That's why the<br /> [Data Platform team of Yandex.Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/services#data-platform) designed SPQR.

Our team has been exploring different approaches to sharding a PostgreSQL cluster for a long time.  We have considered FDW-based sharding, CustomNode-based sharding, C-implemented lightweight query routing, and finally came to the SPQR design.

SPQR is a good fit for:

- Developers who are comfortable with Postgres and prefer not to use other database engines
- Developers who cannot or do not wish to implement sharding logic on the application level
- A database that is well splitted by a sharding key
- Single-shard OLTP queries
