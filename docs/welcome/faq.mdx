## General Questions

**Q: When should SPQR be used, and when is it not a good fit?**

**A:**

**Use SPQR when:**

* Your data no longer fits on a single PostgreSQL instance (> several TB).
* You experience performance degradation in reads/writes, and vertical scaling has reached its limits.
* You need to “cool down” part of your data without losing availability.
* Your database is already sharded and you need automated re-sharding.
* Recommended to start sharding when you have >40 CPU cores, >4 hosts, or >600 GB of data.

**SPQR is not suitable when:**

* You have complex queries involving multiple shards (e.g., cross-shard JOINs).
* Transactions modify data across multiple shards.
* You need OLAP workloads — use **Greenplum** instead.

**Q: Are JSONB and large objects supported?**

**A:** Yes. SPQR is fully compatible with PostgreSQL data types, including JSONB. Keep in mind that large objects can impact network performance.

**Q: How does SPQR differ from other solutions (Citus, ShardingSphere, Neon, Vitess, YDB)?**

**A:**

* **License:** SPQR uses the open PostgreSQL license.
* **Simplicity:** SPQR is built to solve a single, focused problem — routing application queries to shards.
* **Performance:** SPQR is optimized for minimal overhead.

**Q: What technologies is SPQR built on, and how is it configured?**

**A:** SPQR is written in **Go** and works directly at the **PostgreSQL protocol** level.
Sharding rules are stored in **etcd**, a distributed key-value store providing consistent, low-latency coordination.
Rules are configured via an **administrative console** (PostgreSQL-compatible protocol).

**Q: Can SPQR be used with other systems and cloud databases?**

**A:** Yes! SPQR is compatible with managed PostgreSQL databases (Yandex Managed PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, etc.).
You can even use **Neon** as a shard for data storage while SPQR routes queries between them.

**Q: How to ensure SPQR high availability?**

**A:**

* Deploy at least **3 routers** in different availability zones.
* Set up alerts for metrics (CPU, connections, errors).
* Use HA-managed services for shards (Odyssey/PgBouncer as connection poolers, PgConsul/Patroni for HA management).

**Q: What happens under high load?**

**A:** It depends on the workload type.
Example: 95% writes, 5% reads.
If the router’s configuration parameter [`default_target_session_attrs`](https://pg-sharding.tech/configuration/router#query-routing-settings) = `read-only`, read queries are distributed among replicas.
If a replica becomes unresponsive (`SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();` timeout), SPQR stops sending queries to it and periodically checks its status in the background. Once it’s healthy again, traffic resumes automatically.

**Q: Are there risks of duplicated queries when using a load balancer in front of SPQR?**

**A:** Yes. If a client disconnects and the load balancer retries the query, SPQR treats it as a new one — potentially causing duplication (e.g., `INSERT`).
Use **idempotent operations** or implement deduplication at the application layer.

**Q: How to set up backups?**

**A:** Full **PITR** (Point-In-Time Recovery) for the SPQR cluster consists of shard PITRs plus a backup of SPQR metadata stored in etcd.
We recommend using **WAL-G** for this purpose.

**Q: How to diagnose issues and collect statistics?**

**A:** Enable debug logging in the router config and use `/* __spqr__reply_notice = true */` for detailed error messages.
The router provides a PostgreSQL-compatible admin console with `SHOW` commands for metrics (e.g., `SHOW clients WHERE dbname = testdb;` or `SHOW shards;`).

**Q: How to configure logging and tracing?**

**A:** Use the following router parameters:

* `log_level` — debug, info, warning, error, fatal
* `pretty_logging` — enables structured output
* `pgproto_debug` — detailed PostgreSQL protocol logging
* `notice_message_format` — configures NOTICE message formatting
  Tracing is available through the `with_jaeger` flag in `feature_flags`, and latency metrics are available via `time_quantiles`.

## Transactions

**Q: How does SPQR process SQL queries?**

**A:** SPQR handles queries differently depending on their type and context:

1. **Regular queries:** SPQR parses the query, identifies the target table, column, and key value, then matches it to pre-defined sharding rules (range or hash). It routes the query to the corresponding shard.
2. **Queries with routing hints:** Query routing can be influenced by special hints (provided as SQL comments or router settings).
3. **Transactions:** When `BEGIN TRANSACTION` is received, SPQR buffers subsequent statements (like `SET` commands) in memory.
   The entire transaction is sent to a specific shard only when the target shard can be determined unambiguously.

**Q: How are multi-shard transactions handled?**

**A:** For atomic cross-shard transactions, use **two-phase commit (2PC):**

1. At session start: `SET __spqr__commit_strategy TO '2pc'`.
2. Or add `/* __spqr__commit_strategy: 2pc */` to your `COMMIT`.
3. Ensure `max_prepared_transactions` > 0 on all shards.
   *Note:* Without 2PC, changes may be partially applied.

**Q: Can queries spanning multiple shards be executed?**

**A:** Yes, but with limitations:

* For cross-shard operations, use `/*__spqr__engine_v2: true*/`.
* `COPY` operations are allowed with `/*__spqr__allow_multishard: true*/`.
* Transactions modifying multiple shards are **not supported**.

**Q: How to explicitly route a query to a specific shard?**

**A:** SPQR supports virtual parameters (hints), set via SQL comments or `SET` statements:

* `__spqr__execute_on` — target specific shard
* `__spqr__distribution` — choose routing distribution
* `__spqr__scatter_query` — broadcast query to all shards

**Q: What commit strategies are supported?**

**A:** The `__spqr__commit_strategy` hint defines the transaction commit mode:

* `best-effort` — default mode, same as `1pc`
* `1pc` — one-phase commit (commits each shard independently, no atomicity guarantees across shards)
* `2pc` — two-phase commit (atomic commits across shards, requires `/* __spqr__engine_v2: true */` and PostgreSQL `max_prepared_transactions` > 0).

For comprehensive information, see [Distributed Transactions](/sharding/distributed_transactions).

**Q: How to use reference tables?**

**A:** Reference tables are replicated across all shards.
Create them with:

```sql
CREATE REFERENCE TABLE table_name (...);
```

or via:

```sql
CREATE DISTRIBUTION ds_repl COLUMN TYPES ... REPLICATED;
ALTER DISTRIBUTION ds_repl ATTACH RELATION table_name ...;
```

Data automatically replicates to all shards. Use `/* __spqr__engine_v2: true */` for writes.

**Q: Can related tables be sharded by the same key?**

**A:** Yes — SPQR allows colocating related data on the same shard, enabling efficient intra-shard JOINs.

**Q: Does SPQR support distributed sequences?**

**A:** Yes — via `CREATE REFERENCE TABLE ... AUTO INCREMENT`. SPQR guarantees globally unique IDs.

**Q: How are queries without a sharding key handled?**

**A:** By default, multi-shard queries (without a key) are **forbidden**.
You can enable them with `/* __spqr__scatter_query: true */`.
Results from all shards are merged, but consistency is not guaranteed.

## Connections and Authentication

**Q: How to connect to SPQR?**

**A:** SPQR uses the standard PostgreSQL protocol — applications see it as a regular PostgreSQL cluster.
You can connect via `psql` or any PostgreSQL driver using the router’s host and port.
The admin console runs on a separate port (defined by `admin_console_port`), e.g.:

```bash
psql host=localhost sslmode=require user=demo dbname=demo port=6432
```

**Q: How do session and transaction pooling work?**

**A:** SPQR supports pooling modes similar to Odyssey/PgBouncer.
Configured via `pool_mode` in frontend rules:

* `SESSION` — a client session is bound to one backend connection
* `TRANSACTION` — connection is released to the pool after each transaction

**Q: What options exist for connection routing control?**

**A:** See [Routing hints](https://pg-sharding.tech/routing/hints).

**Q: Are external drivers (pgx, JDBC, etc.) supported?**

**A:** Yes. SPQR speaks the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so most drivers are compatible.
However, some versions of **pgx** may hang during connection initialization — test your driver setup and report issues to SPQR developers.

## Performance

**Q: How does SPQR performance compare to vanilla PostgreSQL?**

**A:**

* SPQR shows **~10–30% performance drop** depending on workload type compared to vanilla PostgreSQL.
* Optimization work is ongoing.

**Q: What hardware resources are required for routers and coordinators?**

**A:** It depends on workload.
For high RPS (100K+), use strong CPUs (e.g., Intel Ice Lake) and >=16 GB RAM.
Example configurations for ~20,000 RPS:

**Minimal:**

* 3 routers × 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM
* 3 coordinators × 1 vCPU, 4 GB RAM
* **Total:** 15 vCPU, 60 GB RAM

**Optimal:**

* 3 routers × 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM
* 3 coordinators × 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM
* **Total:** 18 vCPU, 72 GB RAM

**With headroom:**

* 5 routers × 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM
* 3 coordinators × 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM
* **Total:** 26 vCPU, 104 GB RAM

## Data Migration and Rebalancing

**Q: How to shard an existing database?**

**A:** Steps:

1. Connect your current cluster as the first shard.
2. Define sharding keys for your tables.
3. Create key ranges covering the entire key space.
4. Add new shards to the config and move data using `REDISTRIBUTE KEY RANGE`.

**Q: How to configure application connections to SPQR?**

**A:**

* Use standard PostgreSQL drivers (e.g., `pgx`).
* Specify all routers in your configuration for load balancing.

**Q: How to shard by a composite key (multiple columns)?**

**A:**

```sql
CREATE DISTRIBUTION ds1 COLUMN TYPES integer, varchar;  
ALTER DISTRIBUTION ds1 ATTACH RELATION orders DISTRIBUTION KEY user_id, order_date; 
```

**Q: How to create a default shard for unassigned keys?**

**A:**

```sql
ALTER DISTRIBUTION {distribution_id} ADD DEFAULT SHARD {shard};
```

**Q: How to add a new shard and rebalance data?**

**A:**

1. Add a new shard in `router.yaml` / `coordinator.yaml` or via `ADD SHARD`.
2. Reassign key ranges using:

   * `SPLIT KEY RANGE` — split range
   * `MOVE KEY RANGE` — move range (locks data)
   * `REDISTRIBUTE KEY RANGE` — automatic migration
3. Use `SYNC REFERENCE TABLES` to copy reference tables.

Rebalancing can be **automatic** (based on CPU/disk load, ε-split) or **manual**.

**Q: What data types are supported for sharding?**

**A:**

* Integer (`int`, `bigint`)
* String (`varchar`)
* UUID
* Hash functions: `CITY`, `MURMUR` (for integers only) — **custom hash functions are not supported**
* Composite keys

**Q: Are JOINs between shards supported?**

**A:** No. JOINs are only allowed within a single shard.
To handle related data, use **colocation** (store related tables on the same shard via a shared key).

**Q: How does SPQR manage connection limits?**

**A:** Connection-level limits (rate limits, user quotas) are planned but not yet implemented.

**Q: Does SPQR provide query deduplication or retry policy?**

**A:** Not yet. If a client disconnects and retries, SPQR treats it as a new query.
Configurable retry strategies are planned.

**Q: When I see `error processing query ... : syntax error`, what should I do?**

**A:** This usually indicates an internal SPQR parser issue rather than an actual SQL syntax error.

**1. Report it to SPQR developers:**

* Include the full query text
* SPQR and PostgreSQL versions
* Sharding configuration

**2. Temporary workaround:**

* Check your query against SPQR documentation
* Simplify the query (split it, remove complex constructs)

**Why does this happen?**
SPQR uses its own SQL parser, which may not fully support:

* Rare PostgreSQL operators
* Nonstandard syntax
* Custom functions
