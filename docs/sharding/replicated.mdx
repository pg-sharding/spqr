title: 'Replicated Tables'
---

Replicated tables, also known as **sharded tables**, are tables that are distributed across multiple shards, allowing each shard to store a portion of the data.

Replicated tables are ideal when:

- Data needs to be split and distributed across multiple shards for performance and scalability.
- You have large datasets that need to be partitioned.
- You need to achieve high availability and fault tolerance by spreading data across multiple servers.
- You want to isolate certain types of queries to specific shards, reducing the query load on other parts of the system.

## Examples

Some typical use cases for replicated tables include:

- **eCommerce**: Product catalogs, where each product has information about categories, descriptions, and prices, which can be sharded based on product IDs.
- **Social Media**: User data and posts, sharded by user ID.
- **Finance**: Transaction records, sharded by account number or transaction ID.
- **IoT**: Data from devices, sharded by device ID or geographical region.
- **Logs and Analytics**: Event logs and analytics data, sharded by date or region.
