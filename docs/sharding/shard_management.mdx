Shard administration.

Shard management shard replication, backup, switchover/failover configuration, and monitoring is seen as a user responsibility.
Initially, SPQR was created as a way to shard PostgreSQL on top of managed DBMS (shard) instances from cloud providers.
As of right now, there are no activities underway to provide a completely open-source shard management solution.
