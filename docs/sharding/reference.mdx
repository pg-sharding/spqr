title: 'Reference Tables'
---

A reference table is a table that is fully replicated across all shards instead of being divided into separate partitions. This allows **every shard to have a local copy of the table**, reducing network overhead and ensuring fast access to frequently used data.

Reference tables are useful when you need:

- Consistent access to shared data across all shards.
- Fast lookups without cross-shard queries.
- Integrity constraints on small tables used across different parts of an application.

## Examples

Some typical use cases for reference tables include:

- **eCommerce**: sales tax rates apply to all stores.
- **Common codes**: a table with country codes and region names.
- **Roles**: a system-wide list of roles and permissions.
- **Finance**: Exchange rates.
- **Global settings**: settings or feature flags.
- **A SaaS platform**: a table defining different subscription tiers, their pricing, and feature sets.

## How to use it?

To create a reference table, use the SPQR administrative console:

```sql
\c spqr-console
CREATE REFERENCE TABLE tax_rates;
         attach table          
-------------------------------
 relation name   -> tax_rates
 distribution id -> REPLICATED
(2 rows)
```

Then, create the table and insert data:

```sql
\c ordersdb
CREATE TABLE tax_rates(i int, j int);
NOTICE: send query to shard(s) : sh1,sh2,sh3,sh4
COPY tax_rates FROM 'test_tax_rates.csv' DELIMITER '\t';
NOTICE: send query to shard(s) : sh1,sh2,sh3,sh4
```

Verify replication:

```sql
TABLE tax_rates /* __spqr__execute_on: sh1 */;
NOTICE: send query to shard(s) : sh1
 country_code | state_code | tax_rate | tax_category

 AU           |            |   10.00  | GST
 IN           |            |   18.00  | GST
(6 rows)

TABLE tax_rates /* __spqr__execute_on: sh2 */;
NOTICE: send query to shard(s) : sh2
