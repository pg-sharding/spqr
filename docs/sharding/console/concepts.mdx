## Distribution

Distribution is a sort of container for all the settings. With distribution, you can shard a part of your database with one logic, and other part is another logic. You may think of distribution like a virtual database.


## Key Range

A key range refers to a range of keys that are used to partition and distribute data across multiple shards. Each key in the range is associated with a specific shard.

You can lookup registered key ranges using command "show key_ranges".
```sql
show key_ranges;
 Key range ID | Shard ID | Distribution ID | Lower bound | Locked 
--------------+----------+-----------------+-------------+--------
 kr1          | sh1      | ds1             | 10          | true
 kr2          | sh1      | ds1             | 5           | false
(2 rows)

```
