### CREATE DISTRIBUTION

This command is used to create a new distribution with the specified name. Optionally, you can specify the column types for the distribution using the COLUMN TYPES clause. Optionally, you can specify a default shard for distribution using the "DEFAULT SHARD" clause.

```sql
CREATE DISTRIBUTION <distributionID> COLUMN TYPES <types> DEFAULT SHARD <shardId>

where types is a comma-separated list of column types

where type is one of: VARCHAR, INTEGER, INT, UUID

where <shardId> is a default shard identifier. The <shardId> must exist.
```

### DROP DISTRIBUTION

This command is used to drop an existing distribution with the specified name. The CASCADE keyword is optional and indicates that any dependent objects should also be dropped.

```sql
DROP DISTRIBUTION <distribution_name> [CASCADE]
```

### ALTER DISTRIBUTION ATTACH RELATION

This command is used to alter an existing distribution. You can attach one or more [relations](/sharding/sharded_tables) to the distribution using the ATTACH RELATION clause.

```sql
ALTER DISTRIBUTION <distribution_name> ATTACH RELATION <relation_name> [, <relation_name> ...] 
DISTRIBUTION KEY <keys> [HASH FUNCTION <hash_function_name>]

where hash_function_name is one of: IDENTITY, MURMUR, CITY
```

### ALTER DISTRIBUTION DETACH RELATION

This command is used to alter an existing distribution. You can detach a relation from the distribution using the DETACH RELATION clause.

```sql
ALTER DISTRIBUTION <distribution_name> DETACH RELATION <relation_name>
```

### ALTER DISTRIBUTION DROP DEFAULT SHARD
This command is used to add default shard to an existing distribution.

```sql
ALTER DISTRIBUTION <distributionID> DROP DEFAULT SHARD
```

### ALTER DISTRIBUTION DROP DEFAULT SHARD
This command is used to add default shard to an existing distribution.

```sql
ALTER DISTRIBUTION <distributionID> DEFAULT SHARD <shardId>
where <shardId> is a default shard identifier. <shardId> must be exist 
```

### CREATE REFERENCE TABLE

This command is used to create a [reference table](/sharding/reference_tables). The `AUTO INCREMENT` argument creates [a sequence](/sharding/reference_tables#sequences).

<Note>You may specify initial sequence value with `START` keyword.</Note>

```sql
CREATE REFERENCE TABLE <table_name> [AUTO INCREMENT <column_name> [, <column_name> ...] >]
CREATE REFERENCE TABLE <table_name> [AUTO INCREMENT <column_name START start_value> [, <column_name START start_value> ...] >]
```

### DROP SEQUENCE

This command is used to drop [a sequence](/sharding/reference_tables#sequences).

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE t1_id;
   drop sequence   
-------------------
 sequence -> t1_id
(1 row)
```

### CREATE KEY RANGE

This command is used to create a new key range. Since the key space is an ordered set, it is enough to specify only one end of the range

```sql
CREATE KEY RANGE [ <keyRangeID> ]
FROM <lowerBound>
ROUTE TO <shardID> 
FOR DISTRIBUTION <distributionID>
```

### DROP KEY RANGE

This command is used to drop an existing key range.

```sql
DROP KEY RANGE <keyRangeID>
```

### MOVE KEY RANGE

<Warning>This command is not available for installations without SPQR coordinator.</Warning>

This command is used to move an existing key range to a different shard.

```sql
MOVE KEY RANGE <keyRangeID> TO <shardID>
```

### REDISTRIBUTE KEY RANGE

<Warning>This command is not available for installations without SPQR coordinator.</Warning>

`REDISTRIBUTE KEY RANGE` command is similar to `MOVE KEY RANGE`, but with one key difference: `REDISTRIBUTE` moves the key range in smaller chunks to minimize downtime for write operations.

`BATCH SIZE` is an integer value that controls the number of keys moved in each batch during redistribution. Default batch size is 500.

You can also use optional keywords `CHECK` and `APPLY`. By default, command will check for the ability to move keys, then perform the actual movement. With `CHECK`, you can perform a dry-run.
With `APPLY`, you can skip checks.

```sql
REDISTRIBUTE KEY RANGE <keyRangeID> TO <shardID> [ BATCH SIZE <batchSize> ] [ CHECK | APPLY ];
```

### SPLIT KEY RANGE

This command is used to split an existing key range into two separate key ranges.

```sql
SPLIT KEY RANGE <keyRangeID> FROM <keyRangeFromID> BY <border>
```

### UNITE KEY RANGE

This command is used to unite two adjacent key ranges into a single key range.

```sql
UNITE KEY RANGE <keyRangeIDLeft> WITH <keyRangeIDRight>
```

### SHOW

This command is used to retrieve information about a specific entity of SPQR cluster and simple filtering.

```sql
SHOW entity [WHERE where_clause]

where entity is one of databases, routers, pools, shards, backend_connections, key_ranges, clients, status, distributions, version, relations, sequences, task_groups, prepared_statements:
```

The`where_clause` is used to filter the results based on specific conditions. It allows you to specify criteria for selecting the information to be shown.

```sql
spqr-console=> SHOW backend_connections WHERE hostname='hostname:6432'

 backend connection id | router  | shard key name |   hostname    |     user     | dbname | sync | tx_served | tx status
-----------------------+---------+----------------+---------------+--------------+--------+------+-----------+-----------
 824694216064          | no data | app-prod-spqr1 | hostname:6432 | test_app_app | testdb | 0    | 10102     | IDLE
 824646300800          | no data | app-prod-spqr1 | hostname:6432 | test_app_app | testdb | 0    | 7508      | IDLE
 824682931072          | no data | app-prod-spqr1 | hostname:6432 | test_app_app | testdb | 0    | 16623     | IDLE

```

Exists feature - order by col asc/desc for clients.

```sql
SHOW clients ORDER BY <column> (ASC/DESC)
```

The ORDER BY column feature works with clients, not works with other entities.

### KILL CLIENT

This command is used to terminate a specific client connection in a SPQR Router.

```sql
KILL CLIENT <client_id>
```
### INVALIDATE CACHE

This command is used to invalidate the cache for a specific schema or the entire cache in the SPQR Router.

```sql
INVALIDATE CACHE
```
