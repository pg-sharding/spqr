The coordinator consists of two parts: the coordinator itself and the QDB.

- The **SPQR Coordinator** provides an interface for managing a sharded cluster configuration and routers. 
- **QDB** stores the metadata for a sharded cluster, which includes the distributions, key ranges, tables, distributed locks, and so on. It's a regular etcd cluster (https://etcd.io)
