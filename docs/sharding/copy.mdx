title: 'COPY FROM'
---

The `COPY` command allows for efficient bulk copying of data into a sharded table. The data will be distributed across shards according to your sharding setup. For more information on the PostgreSQL `COPY` command, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html).

<Warning>
You should be careful with this feature. If you don't use two-phase commit. There is no concept of snapshot isolation across shards in SPQR. That means:

- A SELECT that runs on multiple shards at the same time may see results from some shards, but not from others.
- If an error occurs on a shard when you do a COPY, the transaction is rolled back only on that shard.
</Warning>

Some examples:

```sql
COPY xx (i, j) FROM STDIN WITH DELIMITER '|';
1|1
2|2
3|3
...
\.
NOTICE: send query to shard(s) : shard1,shard2,shard3,shard4
```

```bash
dbname=> \copy "spqr-test" (uid, data)  from 'data_test.csv' WITH DELIMITER ';';
NOTICE: send query to shard(s) : shard1,shard2,shard3,shard4
```
