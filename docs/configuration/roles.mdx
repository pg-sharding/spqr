## Roles

Roles represents a collection of table groups. It is used to define and manage groups of tables in the configuration. The structure supports JSON, TOML, and YAML serialization formats.

By default, the role system is disabled. To enable it, you have to specify `enable_role_system: true` and `roles_file` settings in both your [router's](./router) and [coordinator's](./coordinator) config.

Refer to the [pkg/config/roles.go](https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/blob/master/pkg/config/roles.go) file for the most up-to-date configuration options.

## Table Group

TableGroup represents a group of tables with associated roles and permissions.

| Setting  | Description                                           | Possible Values       |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `id`     | Unique identifier for the table group.                | Any string value      |
| `readers`| List of users with read access to the table group.    | Array of string values|
| `writers`| List of users with write access to the table group.   | Array of string values|
| `admins` | List of users with admin access to the table group.   | Array of string values|

## Example

For example, let's assume we have the following roles configuration:

```yaml
table_groups:
  - id: "example_table_group"
    readers:
      - "user1"
      - "user2"
      - "user3"
    writers:
      - "prod_user"
    admins:
      - "admin_user"
```

When we try to connect to (any) database as user user1 and run a modify query, we get something like this: 

```sql
CREATE KEY RANGE krid2 FROM 11 ROUTE TO sh2 FOR DISTRIBUTION ds1;
ERROR:  permission denied for user=user1 dbname=prod
```
