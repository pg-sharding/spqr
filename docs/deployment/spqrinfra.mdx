## Overview

SPQR Infra mode is a special deployment where each `spqr-router` instance acts as **both a router and a coordinator** in a single binary. This mode is ideal when you want to save CPU and memory resources or simplify your deployment architecture.

In SPQR Infra mode:
- A single `spqr-router` binary provides both routing and coordination functions
- Multiple instances form a distributed consensus group
- An etcd cluster is required for distributed state
- You should run an odd number of instances (1, 3, or 5)
- Reduced operational overhead compared to separate router and coordinator deployments

## Setup

### 1. Deploy etcd Cluster
